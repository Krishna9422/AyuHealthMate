# 🌿 AyurAid – AI-Powered Disease Predictor with Ayurvedic Treatment Suggestions

**AyurAid** is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts possible diseases based on symptoms entered in natural language and suggests relevant Ayurvedic treatments. It combines the power of **machine learning** and **natural language processing** to provide health insights rooted in traditional Indian medicine.

## 🧠 Features

- 📝 **Natural Language Symptom Input**  
  Type symptoms freely—no dropdowns or checkboxes.

- 🤖 **ML-Based Disease Prediction**  
  Uses a trained Random Forest model to predict diseases from symptom vectors.

- 🔍 **Fuzzy Matching**  
  Even partial or misspelled symptoms (like "fever" vs "high fever") are matched accurately.

- 🌿 **Ayurvedic Treatment Suggestions**  
  Provides treatments from a curated Ayurvedic database, even when prediction is uncertain.

- ⚠️ **Smart Fallbacks**  
  If disease prediction isn’t confident, the app suggests treatments based on symptoms alone.

- 🧘 **Safe Guidance**  
  Disclaimer included: this app is for informational use and not a substitute for medical consultation.
